# Morning Outlook by ye_fanboys

## Project Description
Our website is a dashboard that centralizes all of the things that a user would want on a single site.  Our current design will use specific apis to create widgets that would contain everything the user needs, such as weather, an editable to do list, the news, and entertainment in forms of a meme celebrity Kanye West (and other things).
