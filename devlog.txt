- added the kanye api and tried to troubleshoot a 503 error that kept occuring

andyL -- 2021-12-13 15:25

- fixed the issue where the kanye api failed to load (probably because the kanye api thought we were a bot based on the fact that no browser data was attached)
- added 411 on unsplash api so that I can implement the api
- implemented the unsplash api
- removed code references from testing the other apis to see if they worked
